# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Pre-Prerequisites
======================================================================
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- node >= 18
- npm >= 8
To install the above, I highly recommend using a node version manager (i.e. https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Setup
=====================================================================
Run this script to install project dependencies:
```Bash
git clone git@github.com:mwaurajr/Venu-Spot-FrontEnd.git
```

```Javascript
npm install
```

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
